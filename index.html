					<h3 class="">Universal Car Wheel Anti-skid Device</h3>
					<p class="">The device was mainly sold and used in northeastern China, where the climate is very similar to the on in Canada. The winter is northeastern China is also very long and cold, with heavy snowfall. Mr.Zhang's device has received a general welcome from vehicle drivers. During his business exploratory trip to Saskatchewan, considering several factors, Mr.Zhang had an idea that he should produce and sell his universal car wheel anti-skid device in Saskatchewan and help Canadian drivers to rescue themselves in winter. His future business in Sasketchewan will fall into code 399-Miscellaneous Manufacturing of the North American Industry Cassification System Canada 2017 version 2.0.</p>
